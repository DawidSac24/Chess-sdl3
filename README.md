# Chess-sdl
This a a chess game made in cpp with the sdl3 library. I decided to make this project to progress in cpp, getting a better understanding of the language.
I have made a simillar project for my middle-school's final year project, [Auto-Mate]([https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/content-manager/lobbohngjkkghmganebnahlfajlahkic](https://github.com/DawidSac24/AutoMate)). It's an automatic chessboard with a mechanism similar to 3d printers. Since i wanted to code a min-max algorithm myself but didn't have time, i decided to remake a chess game in cpp. I wanted to make it easier to showcase and to code (since the initial project was made on arduino).

# Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome! Whether youâ€™ve found a bug, have a feature request, or want to improve the code or documentation, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. This project is a great place to learn, collaborate, and grow together.

# Future plans
I decided to make the chess game with sdl because i saw that it is possible to easily compile to webassembly, wich would allow me to implement it on a website (my portfolio for exemple).

# TODO
- [ ] Repair the crash on certein squares movement with the rook
